The directory contains some PNG images.

* WEEF\_1.png: a complete image that contains multiple IDAT chunks. This file does not follow the simple PNG format defined in the lab manual. It is here for visual inspection only.
* red-green-16x16.png: an image containing one red bar on the left and one green bar on the right
* cropped: cropped images by splitting the WEEF\_1.png from top to bottom (i.e. vertically). Each cropped image is a horizontal strip of the original image.
