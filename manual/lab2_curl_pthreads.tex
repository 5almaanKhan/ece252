\chapter{Multi-threaded Programming with Blocking I/O}
\label{ch2_pthreads}

\section{Objectives}
The purpose of this lab is to learn about and gain practical experience with multi-threaded programming in a Linux environment. A single-thread implementation using blocking I/O to request a resource across the network is provided. You are asked to reduce the latency of this operation by sending out multiple requests simultaneously to different machines by using the \verb+pthreads+ library. After this lab, you will have a good understanding of
\begin{itemize}
  \item  how to design and implement a multi-threaded program by using the \verb+pthreads+ library
  \item  the role that multi-threading plays in reducing the latency of a program
\end{itemize}

\section{Starter Files}
The starter files are on GitHub at \url{http://github.com/broehl/ece252} in the lab2/starter directory.
That directory contains the following sub-directories where we have example code to help you get started:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb+cURL+ demonstrates how to use cURL to fetch an image segment from the lab web server
    \item \verb+fn_ptr+ demonstrates how C function pointers work
    \item \verb+getopt+ demonstrates how to parse command line options
    \item \verb+pthreads+ demonstrates how to create two threads
    \item \verb+times+ provides helper functions to measure program execution times
\end{itemize}
Using the code in the starter files is permitted and will not be considered as plagiarism.

\section{Preparation}
Read the entire lab2 manual to understand what the lab assignment is about. Build the starter code and run the executables. Read through the code samples and understand what they do and how they work. Create a single-threaded implementation of the \verb+paster+ command (see \ref{sec:man_paster_par}).

\section{Lab Assignment}
\subsection{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:lab2_problem_statement}
In the previous lab, a set of horizontal strips of a PNG image file were stored in local files and you were asked to restore the image from those strips. In this lab, the horizontal image segments are on the web. There are three $400 \times 300$ pictures (whole images) on three web servers. When you ask a web server to send you a picture, the web server crops the picture into fifty
$400 \times 6$ equally sized horizontal strips
\footnote{Each image segment will have a size less than 8KB.}. The web server assigns a sequence number to each strip from top to bottom starting from 0 and incrementing by 1
\footnote{The first horizontal strip has a sequence number of 0, the second strip has a sequence number of 1. The sequence number increments by 1 from top to bottom and the last strip has a sequence number of 49.}. Then the web server sleeps for a random time and then sends out a random strip in the simple PNG format that we assumed in lab1. That is, each horizontal strip PNG image segment consists of one IHDR chunk, one IDAT chunk and one IEND chunk (see Figure \ref{fig_png_file_format}). The PNG segment is an 8-bit RGBA image (see Table \ref{lab1:tb_IHDR_Data} for details). The web server uses an HTTP response header that includes the sequence number to tell you which strip it's sending you. The HTTP response header has the format ``X-Ece252-Fragment: $M$'' where $M \in [0, 49]$. To request a random horizontal strip of picture $N$, where $N\in[1,3]$, use the following URL:
\verb+http://machine:2520/image?img=N+, where \texttt{machine} is one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{ece252-1.uwaterloo.ca}
\item \texttt{ece252-2.uwaterloo.ca}
\item \texttt{ece252-3.uwaterloo.ca}
\end{itemize}

For example, when you request data from the following URL: \\
\verb+http://ece252-1.uwaterloo.ca:2520/image?img=1+  \\
you will receive a random horizontal strip of picture 1. If, for example, this random strip that you receive is the third horizontal strip (from top to bottom of the original picture), the received HTTP header will contain ``X-Ece252-Fragment: 2``. The received data will be the image segment in PNG format.
You may use the browser to view a random horizontal strip of the PNG image the server sends. You will notice the same URL displays a different image strip every time you refresh the page. Each strip has the same dimensions of $400 \times 6$ pixels and is in PNG format. 

Your objective is to request all horizontal strips of a picture from the server and then concatenate these strips to restore the original picture. The server sends a random strip each time. If you use a loop to keep requesting a random strip from a server, you may receive the same strip multiple times before you receive all fifty distinct strips. Due to the randomness, it will take a variable amount of time to get all the strips you need to restore the original picture.

\subsection{Requirements}

You will create an executable called \verb+paster+. The behaviour of the command \verb+paster+ is given in the "man page" later in this lab manual.

You should start by creating a single-threaded implementation of \verb+paster+ that requests all the image segments from a web server by using blocking I/O and then concatenate these segments together to form the complete image.
A single-threaded implementation will be relatively slow, but it will let you sort out all the challenges of accessing files over the web, assembling them and so on before introducing the use of multiple threads.
If you are unable to implement threading, you will still get partial marks for a single-threaded implementation (see the marking rubric later in this chapter).

The provided starter code \verb+main_write_header_cb.c+ in the \verb+cURL+ directory will be helpful. It illustrates how to use the \verb+libcurl+ blocking I/O function \verb+curl_easy_peform()+ to fetch one random horizontal strip of picture $1$ from one of the web servers into memory and then output the received image segment to a PNG file. Your program should repeatedly fetch the image strips until you have them all. Since you get a random strip each time, the amount of time to get all fifty distinct strips of a picture varies.

You will notice the blocking I/O operation is the main cause of the latency. Your program will be blocked each time it calls \verb+curl_easy_perform()+.

Once you have the single-threaded version working, you will implement a multi-threaded version that reduces the latency of the web operations by sending out multiple blocking I/O requests simultaneously (to different machines) by using \verb+pthreads+.
\footnote{Asynchronous I/O is another method to reduce the latency, and we will explore it in lab5.}. 

Your program should create as many threads as the user specifies on the command line, and distribute the work among the three provided servers. Make sure all of your library  calls are {\em thread-safe} (for glibc, e.g. \code{man 3 printf} to look at the documentation).

The provided three pictures on the server are for you to test your program. Your program should work for all these pictures. You may want to reuse part of your lab1 code to paste the received image segments together.

\section{Programming Tips}
\label{sec:code-walk-through}

\subsection{The libcurl API}
Although sample code for using \verb+libcurl+ is provided, you should familiarize yourself with the libcurl API to help you understand how the provided code works. The libcurl documentation can be found at \url{https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl}. The man page for each function in the libcurl API can be found at URL \url{https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/allfuncs.html}.

Note that the provided example \verb+cURL+ code downloads the received image segment to memory and then outputs the data in memory to a PNG file. The output to a PNG file is just to make it easier for you to view the downloaded image segment to help you understand the example code. However your \verb+paster+ program does not need to output each received segment to a file. An efficient way (i.e. without unnecessary file I/O) is to directly store the received image segment data in memory instead of outputting the data to a file first and then reading the data back from that file into memory. 


\subsubsection{Thread Safety}
\label{sec:libcurl-thread-safety}

Libcurl is thread safe, but there are a few exceptions. The man page of libcurl-thread(3) (see \url{https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/threadsafe.html}) is the ultimate reference. Here are a few key points from the libcurl manual that are relevant to this lab:
\begin{itemize}
\item The same libcurl handle should not be shared by multiple threads. 
\item The libcurl library is thread safe, but does not have any internal thread synchronization mechanism. You will need to take care of the thread synchronization yourself.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{The pthreads API}
\label{sec:pthreads}
You should read the \verb+pthreads(7)+ man page to get an overview of POSIX threads. The SEE ALSO section near the bottom of the man page lists functions in the API. The man pages of \verb+pthread_create(3)+, \verb+pthread_join(3)+ and \verb+pthread_exit(3)+ provide detailed information on how to create, join and terminate a thread.

\subsubsection{The pthread Memory Leak Bug}
\label{sec:pthread-memory-leak}

There is a known memory leak bug related to \verb+pthread_exit()+. Please refer to  \url{https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=483821} for details. Using \verb+return+ instead of \verb+pthread_exit()+ will avoid the memory leak bug.

\section{Deliverables}

\label{sec:lab2-lab-deliverable}
Create a multi-threaded implementation of the \verb+paster+ command.
The following are the steps to create your lab submission.
\begin{itemize}
\item Create a directory (under your ECE252 directory) and name it Lab2.
\item Put the entire source code with a Makefile under the directory Lab2. The Makefile default target is \verb+paster+. That is, the command \verb+make+ should generate the \verb+paster+ executable file. We also expect that the command \verb+make clean+ will remove the object code and the default target. That is, the \verb+.o+ files and the executable file should be removed.
\item Use the \verb+zip+ command to zip up the contents of the Lab2 directory and name it lab2.zip. We expect \verb+unzip lab2.zip+ will produce a \verb+Lab2+ sub-directory in the current working directory and under the \verb+Lab2+ sub-directory will be your source code and the Makefile.
\end{itemize}
Submit the \verb+lab2.zip+ file to Lab2 Dropbox in Learn.
